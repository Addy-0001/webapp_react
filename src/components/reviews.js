        Training with Adamya was the best thing I could have done for my fitness
        goals. Over the course of 3 months, He's helped me lose more than 10
        kilos and in such a way that it's sustainable. For anyone looking for
        guidance, I'd highly recommend Adamya. He's a good Trainer.

        Adamya has been a vital part of keeping me consistent with the exercises
        I do. His method of training is in line with behavior change and he
        makes dynamic training plans and programs depending on how my lifestyle
        changes. He constantly pushes me and checks in very often to ensure that
        I'm doing what we agreed on. I enjoy having him as my trainer and it's
        changed how I approach exercises be it at home or at the gym

        I got see visible effective results on my body in a short period of time
        by training with Adamya. His way of providing training by pushing,
        motivating and controlling daily diet seems to be very effective.
