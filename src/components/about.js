          <h3>A little about me.</h3>
          <p>
            I started training in around February of 2018. I struggled a lot
            with my weight loss journey because of a lack of good training and
            nutrition knowledge. It took me months and months of trying to
            understand the human body and exercise physiology to make a
            sustainable diet and training routine and stick to it. This took
            learning about behavior change as well. After I was able to make a
            good training routine, I started helping out friends who saw rapid
            changes unlike me because of good guidance that I didn't have.
            That's why I decided to start this business and help people gain the
            knowledge necessary to potentially
            <em>
              <b> change their lives.</b>
            </em>
          </p>
        </section>
      </div>
